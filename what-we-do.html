        Phones, simple tools, structure. Projects that build over time.

      <h2 class="reveal">Our Methodology</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Punkeye Pictures is dynamic. The technology works without fuss, and the approach is built on decades of experience in disability arts and filmmaking. We adapt projects to fit the specific needs and abilities of our participants.</p>
      <div class="card-grid">
        <div class="card reveal">
          <h3 class="text-coral">Low barrier, high quality</h3>
          <p>Participants use smartphones and simple digital tools. QR codes link work to projects. No complex equipment. Everyone can contribute from day one.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card reveal">
          <h3 class="text-gold">Daily goals, real projects</h3>
          <p>We break big projects into small, manageable tasks. One simple creative task per day, done well. Over weeks and months, that adds up to finished films and videos.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card reveal">
          <h3 class="text-teal">Contribution, not roles</h3>
          <p>We don't assign or train people for specific roles. Participants contribute in whatever ways work for them. The structure supports different kinds of participation and lets contributions build on each other.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card reveal">
          <h3 class="text-magenta">Your pace, no deadlines</h3>
          <p>Each artist works at their own pace. No deadlines. We have time. Projects move when they're ready.</p>
        </div>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="reveal">For Organizations</h2>
      <p class="reveal">We teach caregivers the model. They run it with their clients in day programs. We provide training, support, and oversight. Punkeye slots into what they already do—no expensive equipment, no specialized instructors. We provide structure, repeatable workflows, and projects people can return to.</p>
      <p class="reveal">We also offer branded services: an organization can hire us to deliver Punkeye under their own name (e.g., "MOBI TV"). We set it up, train their staff, and support them. More on that when we launch.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="reveal">For Families and Individuals</h2>
      <p class="reveal">We don't provide personal care. We work with clients alongside their caregivers or family—weekly or daily sessions. Client + caregiver + Punkeye guidance. We're also looking at drop-ins—a few times a week at different spots—to help people get out and stay engaged.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="reveal">Our Model &amp; Scalability</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Punkeye Pictures is a project-based media system for people excluded from traditional creative and employment pathways. It replaces passive programming with structured, repeatable workflows that lead to completed works. Continuity, authorship, accessible tools. Built to scale through templated workflows, toolkits, and facilitator training.</p>
