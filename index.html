        A structured creative program for youth and adults with developmental disabilities. Projects that run over weeks and months, not one-off activities. And real pride in what you make.

      <h2 class="reveal">From one-off to ongoing</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Daily craft projects aren't disposable here. Each piece feeds into an ongoing work—something that builds over time.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="reveal">Why Punkeye Pictures exists</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Too many people with disabilities end up in programs that fill time instead of building it. Same thing every day. No sense of moving forward.</p>
      <p class="reveal">We're building something different: structured creative work. People contribute to media projects—short films, video, digital art—over weeks and months. The focus is routine, purpose, and the satisfaction of making something that lasts.</p>

        <div class="card reveal">
          <h3 class="text-coral">Authorship over output</h3>
          <p>Creative value isn't defined by who holds the camera. It's defined by who makes the decisions and keeps the project going.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card reveal">
          <h3 class="text-gold">Continuity over novelty</h3>
          <p>Projects unfold over time. Participants experience weeks and months moving forward—not looping back to the same one-off activities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card reveal">
          <h3 class="text-teal">Every body has a story</h3>
          <p>We believe everyone has a story worth telling. Our job is to make it possible to tell it—using tools that work for each person.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="reveal">For families, organizations, and funders</h2>
      <p class="reveal">We work with caregivers, day programs, and families. We enhance what's already there—we don't replace it. Phones and simple tools that staff already have. The aim isn't perfection; it's participation, confidence, and something to show for it.</p>
