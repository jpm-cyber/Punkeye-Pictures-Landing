        Punkeye Pictures helps people with developmental disabilities make films and videos—using phones and simple tools, in collaboration with caregivers and day programs. Projects run over weeks and months, not as one-off activities. Here, you can take real pride in what you make.

      <h2 class="reveal">Art for the timeline, not the landfill</h2>
      <p class="reveal">In many programs, daily craft projects are disposable. At Punkeye, we treat every creative choice—a photo, a sketch, or a short video clip—as a permanent building block. We use professional systems to ensure daily efforts build into substantial films that last. Nothing is thrown away.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="reveal">A way in</h2>
      <p class="reveal">The filmmaking world has long been guarded by gates that are difficult for many to open. Punkeye Pictures is designed to be a universal way in.</p>

        <div class="card reveal">
          <h3 class="text-coral">Diverse Paths, One Purpose</h3>
          <p>Not every participant follows the same road. For some, this will become a lifelong creative practice—a steady rhythm of daily routine and joy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card reveal">
          <h3 class="text-gold">Growing into the Future</h3>
          <p>For others, Punkeye provides the professional foundation they've been denied. It is a place to hone skills, build a portfolio, and grow into their future selves as authors and filmmakers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card reveal">
          <h3 class="text-teal">The Luxury of Time</h3>
          <p>We don't force people through unsustainable training pipelines. We provide the structure and the time for talent to emerge at its own pace. Everyone belongs in the creative game—one frame at a time.</p>

      <h2 class="reveal">Why Punkeye Pictures exists</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Too many people with disabilities end up in programs that fill time instead of building it. Same thing every day. No sense of moving forward.</p>
      <p class="reveal">We're building something different: structured creative work. People contribute to media projects over weeks and months. The focus is routine, purpose, and the satisfaction of making something that lasts.</p>
      <div class="card-grid" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">
        <div class="card reveal">
          <h3 class="text-coral">Authorship over output</h3>
          <p>Creative value isn't defined by who holds the camera. It's defined by who makes the decisions and keeps the project going.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card reveal">
          <h3 class="text-gold">Continuity over novelty</h3>
          <p>Projects unfold over time. Participants experience weeks and months moving forward—not looping back to the same one-off activities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card reveal">
          <h3 class="text-teal">Every body has a story</h3>
          <p>We believe everyone has a story worth telling. Our job is to make it possible to tell it—using tools that work for each person.</p>
