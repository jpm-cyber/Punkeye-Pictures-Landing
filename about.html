      <h1>Who we are</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Media production meets disability support. I've done both for a long time.

      <h2 class="reveal">Who we serve</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Day-program providers, families, disability-support organizations, and schools. We work with anyone committed to turning time-filling into capability-building.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="reveal">The Founder</h2>
      <p class="reveal">I've spent over 40 years in broadcasting and film—CBC Radio, the National Film Board, independent documentary—and decades in disability advocacy and community support. I also worked as a Community Support Worker and saw the systemic challenges that day programs face: staff burnout and schedules that often default to time-filling rather than capability-building.</p>
      <p class="reveal">Punkeye Pictures is what happens when those two lives meet. The professional craft of <em>Citizen Sam</em> (NFB, 2006) meets the reality of creating systems that turn passive busywork into work that lasts.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="reveal">Own Voices</h2>
      <p class="reveal">"Own Voices" describes work by people telling their own stories, from their own lived experience, rather than others speaking for them. For disability, it means people with disabilities creating and shaping the narratives about disability. That philosophy matters to me. At Punkeye Pictures, we use technology and structure to create space for people to tell their own stories.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="reveal">The Punkeye Ethos</h2>
      <p class="reveal">The name comes from a childhood acquaintance who stood for independence and humor. It represents our brand: raw, authentic, and defiant against a system that defaults to "filling time".</p>
