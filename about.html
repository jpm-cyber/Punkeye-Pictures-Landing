      <h1>Who we are</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Media production meets disability support. I've done both for a long time.

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="reveal">The founder</h2>
      <p class="reveal">I've spent over 40 years in broadcasting and film—CBC Radio, the National Film Board, independent documentary—and decades in disability advocacy and community support. Founded the BC Society for Disability and Media.</p>
      <p class="reveal">I also worked as a Community Support Worker and saw the systemic challenges that day programs face: staff burnout and schedules that often default to time-filling rather than capability-building.</p>
      <p class="reveal">Punkeye Pictures is what happens when those two lives meet. The craft of <em>Citizen Sam</em> (NFB, 2006), which explored disability and public life, meets the reality of creating systems that turn passive busywork into work that lasts.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="reveal">Own Voices</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Own Voices is a term that's come into wider use—in publishing, in the arts—to describe work by people telling their own stories, from their own lived experience, rather than others speaking for them. For disability, it means people with disabilities creating and shaping the narratives about disability.</p>
      <p class="reveal">That philosophy matters to me. At Punkeye Pictures, we use technology and structure to make it possible—to create space for people to tell their own stories.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="reveal">Our mission</h2>
      <p class="reveal">We aim to enhance the services provided to people with developmental disabilities, not replace them. We work with caregivers, families, and organizations. We provide structure and support—not personal care. We integrate into existing programs. We empower clients and the people who support them.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="reveal">Why "Punkeye"?</h2>
      <p class="reveal">There is a reason. It's a mystery for now.</p>
