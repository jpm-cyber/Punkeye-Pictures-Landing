  <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
  <div class="section-content">
    <p>Punkeye Pictures was founded by filmmaker and entrepreneur JPM to reimagine media creation. Traditional film programs are costly and inaccessible for many adults with developmental disabilities. We built Punkeye to remove these barriers and to put creativity in the hands of participants and their caregivers.</p>
    <p>We believe everyone has a story worth sharing. Through structured daily tasks and a low‑barrier platform, we foster independence, creativity and joy.</p>

    <p><strong>Vision:</strong> Build a global network where marginalised creators produce authentic films, animations and music videos, supported by inclusive facilitators and technology.</p>
    <p><strong>Values:</strong> Human dignity, authentic representation, accessibility, inclusivity, community and continuous learning.</p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Why It Matters</h2>
  <div class="section-content">
    <p>Nearly one in four Canadians aged 15 and older—about eight million people—live with at least one disability【9980207524854†L184-L189】. Yet their stories are often unseen. By offering participants a voice and a platform, we celebrate diversity and promote inclusion.</p>
    <p>Research shows that structured routines, creative tasks and supportive environments improve self‑expression and cognitive health【302504739066730†L116-L128】. Punkeye Pictures brings these benefits to day programs through film and art.</p>
